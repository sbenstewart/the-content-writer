## the-transcript with the-explanation

Giving a line by line interpretation of almost all that was tried to be conveyed.

**:)**

_the-content is about the above typed in emoticon._

**The Emoticon**

_An emoticon is a representation of a facial expression such as a smile or frown, formed by various combinations of keyboard characters and used to convey the-content-writer's feelings or intended tone._

**The Reasons**

_Down here is explained the reason for using the emoticon_

**Ã–**

_The scandinavian chrarcter that looks like a face or something like that._

**..**

**U**

_This is the modern adaptaion of the scandinavian character that all can type with two full stops and a capital U. This can be typed by moset people. But uses two lines and more importanlty doesn't align properly._

**:)**

_The improvised version of the above which is single line, but risks the fact that most people don't understand this emoticon unless it is explained to them. And also that most people don't ask others about what they don't know._

**The watermark :)**
This matches the format of the subheading and that emoticon is used here as well adding up to the context.

**#thecontentwriter#sbenstewart**

_The actual watermark. This suffices explanation._

**Side Note**

_This is the space below the dashed line where the side notes are placed for making it easier for the-content-viewer to understand the content and also to summarise them into the said points._

**Use the above :)**

_the-content-writer thus calls the viewer to use the emoticon for the reasons that are listed down below._

**For Scandinavia and the vikings and the Norse and Thor**

_The emoticon has it's origins way up north in Scandinavia where the vikings, the Norse and the people's favourite Thor have their origins too. So the-content-writer suggests people to use the emoticon for the same reason, to remember them._

**Or at least for Nokia**

_But what is more important is that, the-content-writer being from the era where the internet and mobile computing were just starting to gain traction, it was the humble Nokia device that first displayed this emoticon to those young eyes for the-content-writer. And the same may be the case formost of those reading this._

**Have a great day :)**
