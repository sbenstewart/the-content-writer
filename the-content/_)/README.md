## the-transcript with the-explanation

Giving a line by line interpretation of almost all that was tried to be conveyed.

**:)**

_the-content is about the above typed in emoticon._

**The Emoticon**

_An emoticon is sort of an image that can be represented using the text input from the device._

**The Reasons**

_Down here with the following_
* _Inteliigence is understanding the-content_
* _Intelligent entity is anything that exhibits intelligence_

**Related Logo or B&W Sketch**

_The rounded rectangular space marked by the dotted line in the lower right corner marks the space where the above can be placed. I assume that no explantion for this is needed._

**The watermark for the content**

_The line that precedes the actual watermark. This is so that the-content-viewer can get one more word based pun._

**#thecontentwriter#sbenstewart**

_The actual watermark. This suffices explanation._

**Side Note (Additional side note intro)**

_This is the space below the dashed line where the side notes are placed for making it easier for the-content-viewer to understand the content and also to summarise them into the said points._

**Those features in the colour red cannot be modified**

_All text, boxes and lines in the red colour cannot be changed. This is because they kind of form the base template for the content._

**The alignment, font size and colour and type do not matter**

_The alignment such as the center, left, right or that justified can be neglected. And so too, can be the font size, colour and type. But, in reality the-content-writer would prefer centered text with the 14 point size._

**It is only the content that does**

_Though whatever might be the stringent criteria of the-content-writer, it is the content that really does matter._

## P.S.

This [README.md](README.md) is the template for explaining the-content. 

**Have a great day :)**
