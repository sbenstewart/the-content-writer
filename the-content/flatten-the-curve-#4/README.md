## the-transcript with the-explanation

Giving a line by line interpretation of almost all that was tried to be conveyed.

**Flatten the curve #4**

_the-content-writer flattening the curves for the fourth time._

**Or actually when un-flattening is needed**

_Many people are scared to hell about dying and also are anxious about how the lockdown will take it's toll on them._

**the-curve "you as of now"**

It is the heart beat of the human being. This is kind of what measures if we are still alive. And if your poor little brain is capable of reading this right now, just note the fact that you are alive.

**the-flat-curve "dead for minutes or decades"**

When you are dead, the curve of the heart beat becomes flattened. It could be a mere minutes or a couple of decades.

**the-curve "article needed for immortality"**

To bring the curve back to the normal heartbeats, we are required to carry an article with the following text engraved on it.

**text on top of article**

IN CASE OF DEATH <br>
SEE REVERSE <br>
FOR BIOSTAIS PROTOCOL <br>
FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS <br>
COLLECT REWARD `1,00,000 INR`

**text on bottom of article**

CALL NOW FOR INSTRUCTIONS<br>
`1-800-NNN-NNNN`<br>
PUSH 50,000 U HEPARIN IV<br>
AND DO CPR WHILE COOLING<br>
WITH ICE TO 10C. KEEP PH 7.5<br>
NO AUTOPSY OR EMBALMING

**criteria**

The following are supposed to happen to make sure that you can get your heartbeat back.

1. Someone finds you dead or unconscious.
2. That someone finds the article.
3. That someone reads the text on the article.
4. That someone is motivated by the reward.
5. That someone follows the instructions.
6. You are preserved properly.
7. Biotech develops rapidly.
8. Biotech doesn't leave out the heart.
9. The future world finds it compelling enough to give you your heartbeat.

**spoiler alert**

_You might go to heaven way before many of the above listed criteria happen. `So the-content-writer would warn you all not to trust this article.`_

**Do not just flatten out this watermark**

_The word `flatten` has been used to bring out the lockdown's `flatten curves` trend._

**#thecontentwriter#sbenstewart**

_The actual watermark. This suffices explanation._

**Side Note**

_This is the space below the dashed line where the side notes are placed for making it easier for the-content-viewer to understand the content and also to summarise them into the said points._

**This is a chronological sequence of the content designed and destined(hopefully) to bring out curves that need to be flattened when the content writer is locked down**

_Chronological meaning the organised content being published with an issue number which has been designed and hopefully wanted by the-content-writer to chnage the curves that need to be changed and in some cases flattened._

**Make sure to change the text in red to your preference and inflation**

_Some might find one lakh of rupees too cheap mostly due to the inflation, so change accordingly. And. You might not want that guy who finds you, to call some random toll free BSNL number. So change that as well._

**And note that the content writer does not take any responsibility for your actions**

_Self explanatory._

**Have a great day :)**
