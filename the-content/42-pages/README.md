## the-transcript with the-explanation

Giving a line by line interpretation of almost all that was tried to be conveyed.

**42 Pages**

_42 is a number that hopefully most reading can number. And a page is one or both sides of a sheet of paper in a collection of bound sheets._

**42 for the one who printed it**

_[The tender](the-tender.pdf) shows clearly that the qnswer booklet is 42. The tender is available on the [notorious link](https://www.annauniv.edu/tender/pdf/coetender.pdf) which could disappear for no reason._

**Just 42 for the one who prepped**

_Those people, those who study cover to cover. Yup. Those people lament that they have to fill only 42 pages._

**4..2.. for the one who didn't**

_And those people, who don't study a single word. Those people lament that they have no idea on how to fill those 42 pages._

**End of stanza**

_the-content-writer is exhausted enough to explain this._

**When it's actually 40**

_Why it is not 42 pages, but only 40 pages._

**With 2 where you can't write**

It is a scheme that they employ. Just look into [the tender](the-tender.pdf).

**Or at least can't be scored**

_The printed rule on those pages state the same._

**Theoretically**

_They state that the answers in those pages wouldn't be scored. But as for as the good will of most staffs go. They do so._

**End of stanza**

_the-content-writer is too bored to even copy paste from the above instance where the same appeared._

**Let's bring the change**

_So the-content-writer appeals to those who appear for those exams to bring the change._

**#onlyfortypages**

_The change being that we only write 40 pages and it is not 42 pages._

**End**
_The End. End meaning the final part of something, especially a period of time, an activity, or a story. In this case. This rant of the-content-writer._

**Mark here the watermark**

The word `mark` has been used to remind you of the fact that the additional two pages can't be given `marks`. And so atleast this `watermark` deserves it.

**#thecontentwriter#sbenstewart**

_The actual watermark. This suffices explanation._

**Side Note**

_This is the space below the dashed line where the side notes are placed for making it easier for the-content-viewer to understand the content and also to summarise them into the said points._

**It really helps when the index count starts from a postive non-uno number**

_th-content-writer brings up the point that the numbering of the pages must start from three which is not a negative number and also not the number one, to account for the lost pages._

**Have a great day :)**
