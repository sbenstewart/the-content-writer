## the-transcript with the-explanation

Giving a line by line interpretation of almost all that was tried to be conveyed.

**(No)Techofes**

_the-content-writer feels that the name for this festival is ambiguous._

**When they can't even get the name right**

_Thus as the name is ambiguous, the-content-writer holds those in charge of conducting this featival responsible for this festival's name._

**What you understand**

_What the commmon engineering graduate will understand from the name. The engineering graduate is taken as the principal subject because it is that entity which will be at most risk of attending that festival._

**Technical Festival**

_This is what that common engineering graduate will understand. The reasoning is that the name is Tech(nical)o(h)fes(tival). And this is intended in the-content by using the red text format._

**What they say**

_This is what the common organiser of the festival whom they say to have been selected after a rigorous selection process by a stringent panel made of a few profs of the college that the-content-writer happened to study._

**Not a Technical Festival**

_These organisers seem to market this Techofes as a purely non technical festival. Though they kind of contradict themsleves whenever they utter the name of the festival._

**What the doomed college website says**

_This is what the official college website says about the festival. [The link to the college website.](https://www.annauniv.edu/campustour/techofes.php) The link is prone to change and so the-content-writer would suggest you to google it for yourself._

**Techofes is the annual cultural festival of College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai held in mid February, and is one of the most popular cultural festivals in South India. Techofes is held for 4 nights and 3 days which draws a footfall of about 40,000 students from more than 250 colleges across South India.**

_This is an extract from the website whose link has been mentioned. No text has been edited or changed by the-content-writer._

**Technically the watermark**

The word `technically` has been used to march that of the non`tech` fest named `Techofes`.

**#thecontentwriter#sbenstewart**

_The actual watermark. This suffices explanation._

**Side Note**

_This is the space below the dashed line where the side notes are placed for making it easier for the-content-viewer to understand the content and also to summarise them into the said points._

**Whatever that you all can bicker about**

_the-content-writer doesn't want to know about what you are about to bicker as this matter is of utmost importance._

**the-content-writer wants this non tech fest name changed**

_The matter that the-content-writer puts forward. Hope it is clear and straight forward._

**#ChangeTheName#NoTechofes**

_These are the tags that could be used by you to voice your opinion on the internet. The content writer just wants to change the name and doesn't want to stop the festival. But the ambiguous second hashtag is placed there for the very same reason._

**Have a great day :)**
