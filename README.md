The content ever published by the content writer.

## Prerequisites

Nothing. Literrally nothing. Yes. You've read this right. For now. But could change soon. So, the content writer would suggest you to always stay updated on this repo.

## The legal stuff

This work which means all the content inside the `/the-content` sub-directory is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

This repo which provides the content is under an [MIT License](/LICENSE). But this does not contain the `/the-content` subdirectory.

The badges for those licenses are as follows. Click on them to read in detail about what they mean.

What the above means is what it means. But if you have any doubt, do contact the [content-writer](mailto:sbenstewart@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20the-content-writer).

## How to use

All the content is present in the `the-content` subdirectory. What else do I type here. Oh, wait. Got it. All the [draw.io](http://draw.io/) templates have been provided for making it easier for you to adapt the content, provided it matches the terms specified in the LICENSES and also satisfies the content-writer. Which is kind of hard to do.

## Why use

Unless you are totally obsessed with the content, there is no point on using this repo. So, good luck trying to. Especially understanding all posts. But, FYI, there is a plan to add explanatory posts for content. Each one of them.

## Road map
* Get back on some feasible schedule so that the content-writer can publish the content.
* Document the explanation for all the content.
* Posting it on some social media platform so that more of them become content-viewers.
* Creating some online independent platform for the content.
* Creating a mail thread for the same.

## Acknowledgements
Down here the-content-writer would like to acknowledge all those that made the-content possible.

* [xkcd-font](http://xkcd.com/1350/xkcd-Regular.otf) without which the whole content thing would fall apart.
* [Drawio Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drawio-desktop/pebppomjfocnoigkeepgbmcifnnlndla?hl=en-GB) that made it possible to develop the content offline.
* [One junior who wants to remain anonymous](https://www.techradar.com/in/how-to/how-to-become-anonymous-online) who asked me if I developed content like this, to which in fact the-content-writer replied with a negative, and then got started developing the-content.
